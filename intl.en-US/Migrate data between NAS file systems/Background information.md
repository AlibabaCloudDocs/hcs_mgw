This section describes how to migrate data between Network Attached Storage \(NAS\) file systems.

Alibaba Cloud Data Transport is used as a data channel between various data stores. With Data Transport, you can migrate data between NAS file systems.

With Data Transport, you only need to log on to the console, specify a data source address and a destination OSS endpoint, and then create a migration job. After starting a migration job, you can perform management tasks for the job such as viewing the progress and status of the job. Additionally, you can view the list of successful migration files and the list of failed migration files.
