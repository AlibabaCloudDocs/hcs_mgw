This topic describes how to migrate data from Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\) to Alibaba Cloud Network Attached Storage \(NAS\).

Alibaba Cloud Data Transport is used as a data channel between various data stores. With Data Transport, you can migrate data from third-party data stores to NAS.

With Data Transport, you only need to log on to the console, specify a source data address and a destination NAS data address, and then create a migration job. After a migration job is started, you can manage the job. For example, you can view the progress and status of the job and view the list of successful migration files and the list of failed migration files.
