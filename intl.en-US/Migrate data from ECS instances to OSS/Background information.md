This guide describes how to migrate shared files from ECS instances to Object Storage Service \(OSS\).

Alibaba Cloud Data Migration Service is used as a data channel between various data stores. With Data Migration Service, you can migrate shared files from ECS instances to OSS.

To migrate these shared files, you only need to enter the data addresses for both shared files and OSS, and then create a migration job. After starting a migration job, you can perform management tasks for the job such as viewing the process and status of the job. Additionally, you can view the list of files to be migrated and the list of files that failed to be migrated.
