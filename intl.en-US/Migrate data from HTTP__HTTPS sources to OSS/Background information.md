This topic describes how to migrate network resources to Object Storage Service \(OSS\).

Alibaba Cloud Data Transport is used as a data channel between various data stores. With Data Transport, you can migrate data from third-party data stores to OSS or between OSS buckets.

With Data Transport, you only need to log on to the console, specify a source data address and a destination OSS endpoint, and then create a migration job. After starting a migration job, you can perform management tasks for the job such as viewing the progress and status of the job. Additionally, you can generate the migration report to view the list of migrated files and the list of files that failed to migrate.
