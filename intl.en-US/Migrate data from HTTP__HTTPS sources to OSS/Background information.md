This topic describes how to migrate network resources to Object Storage Service \(OSS\).

Alibaba Cloud Data Transport is used as a data channel between various data stores. With Data Transport, you can migrate data from third-party data stores to OSS or between OSS buckets.

To migrate data, you only need to enter the data addresses for both the data source and OSS destination, and then create a migration job. After starting a migration job, you can perform management tasks for the job such as viewing the process and status of the job. Additionally, you can generate the migration report to view a list of migrated files and a list of failed files.
